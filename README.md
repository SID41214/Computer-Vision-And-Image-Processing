## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for those interested in exploring computer vision and image processing. It includes implementations of classic and state-of-the-art algorithms, as well as practical projects and experiments in areas such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and histogram equalization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Algorithms like SIFT, SURF, and HOG.
- **Object Detection**: Implementations of YOLO, SSD, and Haar Cascades.
- **Image Segmentation**: Techniques including watershed, thresholding, and GrabCut.
- **Deep Learning**: Models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks like image classification and semantic segmentation.
- **Video Analysis**: Motion detection, object tracking, and optical flow.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-vision-image-processing.git
   cd computer-vision-image-processing 


2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run individual scripts for different tasks. For example, to perform edge detection on an image:
```bash
  python edge_detection.py --input path/to/image.jpg
```

## Examples
### Image Classification
  A simple example of classifying images using a pre-trained CNN model:

  ```bash
python classify_image.py --model models/resnet50.pth --input data/sample.jpg
```
### Object Detection
Detect objects in a video using YOLO:

```bash
python detect_objects.py --model models/yolo.h5 --input data/video.mp4
```
