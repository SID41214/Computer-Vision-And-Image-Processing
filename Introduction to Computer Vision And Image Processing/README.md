## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Basic image transformations, filtering, noise reduction, and edge detection.
- **Object Detection**: Implementations of object detection techniques using deep learning (YOLO, SSD, etc.).
- **Feature Extraction**: Techniques such as SIFT, SURF, ORB, and Harris Corner Detection.
- **Image Segmentation**: Semantic segmentation, thresholding, watershed, and clustering.
- **Face Recognition**: Real-time face recognition using OpenCV and pre-trained models.
- **Deep Learning for Vision**: Custom neural networks for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.
